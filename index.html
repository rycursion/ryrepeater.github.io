Hello Web!
I am an undergraduate electronics engineering student currently studying at the Indraprastha Institute of Information Technology. My interests are VLSI, embedded logic and hardware design.
This is a simple (and free!) site I created to allow me to advertise my <a href="rahulroyresume.pdf">resume</a> and skills (or lack thereof).
